What is this?
-------------

Collection of talks, blogposts, tutorials or anything else
that doesn't look like a piece of code but still consists
of text.

How do I use it?
----------------

You read it. If you don't understand it, it's perfectly fine
-- most of my talks are about programming. I'm no writer.
