Are you a Python programmer?
Do you want to learn Python?
Do you want to become a better programmer?
Have you ever been to Florence?

If you've answered yes to at least one of these question and yet
didn't show up at Florence in late June for EuroPython 2011 conference,
then you have no причин ? And no, living in Australia or North America
doesn't qualify as a valid reason, there were people from these
continents.

Whew, that was a longish attempt at making a joke, now let's get to the real
deal, that is, report. I must also note that I didn't stay for the whole
length of EuroPython. Hey, it was my honeymoon!

Talks
=====

Of course, talks are important. They are the reason people come to events
like this. But it's always hard to choose which one suits you better, when
you have 5 talks running in parallel. Sometimes you're sure to run into
conflicts. And it's generally a good thing for conferences, having real
concurenty between speakers. Watching all of the talks might be possible
if you're diagnosed with insomnia or otherwise have tons of free time,
so I'd suggest you take a look at these talks

My talk
=======

Ah, yes, forgot to mention -- I was one of the speakers too. Well, if you
think about using OpenStreetMap data or just looking into using Python
for GIS, my talk might give some hints as to where to start. Check out the
slides here -- alksdjk or just go to talk's page on EuroPython site.


Organization
============

Organization was actually pretty good. If you don't count WiFi issues in,
it was fantastic. Just to make sure, I've made a list of good and bad things.

The good
--------

* Distinguishibility of organisers from conferences visiters. Seriously, using
yellow t-shirts as a uniform was a fantastic idea
* Names on both sides of badges. YES. BOTH SIDES. That was a minor gripe with
PyCon this year -- after wearing the badge for 3 days, the name was almost
invisible and furthermore, just like a sandwich that falls always butter down,
the badge always turned the blank side up.
* Equipment. It worked. 'nuff said.
* Food. Now, this is something I like about Southern Europe in general -- good
food. It's not that easy to cook something delicious for a crowd of 600
people, but cooks at Florence actually did a very good job.
* Wine at lunch. I love wine. I L O V E it! And having a glass wine relaxes you
enough to not care about internet issues anymore. Ah

The bad
-------
