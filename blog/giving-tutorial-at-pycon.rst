This year marks a huge milestone for me -- I'll be giving a tutorial session
at PyCon. Being selected as one of the speakers is not only a great honor
but also a huge responsibility. Whatever, that's not the
point of this post. This is supposed to be a self-advertisement. So, if
you don't know what's OpenStreetMap, how to render a map in Python and
what GIS stands for (or any of the above) -- don't hesitate to
`spend $150 on registration <http://us.pycon.org/2011/tickets/>`_\.
For those of you who think that they can handle this with ease,
I suggest a much more `sophisticated alternative <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/144/>`_\.
I don't recommend this workshop to people not experienced in Python, though.
There're `plenty of other tutorials <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/tutorials/>`_
so don't hesitate to share this information
with your friends, colleagues and random people on the Internet.

Oh, and don't forget to register for the main conference, because it's
probably the only way to find out about
`giant telescopes <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/159/>`_,
`huge robots <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/74/>`_ or
`automation of airplane engines <http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/68/>`_\.

On almost unrelated not, if you have registered for my tutorial and
want to try out all examples while in the session room I'd suggest you
go through this check-list:

* Install Mapnik. See the `installation instructions <http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/MapnikInstallation>`_\.
  There're pre-built packages available for most major platforms, so the install process should be
  straightforward.
* Install `shapely <http://trac.gispython.org/lab/wiki/Shapely>`_\. Play with examples, try to
  recall your geometry classes from school. This will help you feel more comfortable with examples
  I'm going to provide during the session.
* Install PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension. Some of the examples might include
  writing SQL queries, so if you're not familiar with SQL,
  you should probably read some basic tutorial, but that's definitely not obligatory.

Of course, you could just skip all of these and try out the code
samples later after the session, in a calm and quiet setting.
The tutorial itself doesn't force students into constantly
writing code.

In conclusion, don't miss out on your opportunity to
extend your knowledge base and social network, visit PyCon 2011 in Atlanta,
it's going to be cool.
