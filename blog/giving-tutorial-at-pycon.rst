This year marks a huge milestone for me -- I'll be giving a tutorial
at PyCon. Being selected as one of the speakers is not only a great honor
but also a huge responsibility.

Prerequisites
=============

The following is a list of packages which will be used through
the course of tutorial. The optional packages might get dropped
from the final version of the tutorial.



Highly recommended
------------------

* Mapnik
* Shapely
* pyproj
* PostgreSQL with PostGIS

Optional
--------

* Python Imaging Library
* GeoAlchemy
*

Overview
========

The tutorial will explain the math behind projections, then take a
dive into basics of cartography and finish of with rendering course,
in which we'll learn how to build tile server from scratch.


And besides
===========

But PyCon is not only about my tutorial or at least that's what organizers say.
PyCon is a place where you can learn Python from scratch (or should I say,
the hard way LINK TO ZED), make use of social data in your infographics
