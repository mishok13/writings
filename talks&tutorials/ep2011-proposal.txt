Making use of OpenStreetMap data with Python

Ever wondered how web maps are created? Ever wondered if you
could build something like Google Maps over a weekend? You
probably can't, but this talk will show you the basics of
what you need to know, such as importing data, rendering
maps and even building simple routes. And all of this in
Python!

Abstract:
* Learning how OSM data looks
* Parsing and importing the data
* Rendering maps with Mapnik
* Bits of code required to build geocoder
* Building simple router with Python and PostGIS
* And anything else I forgot to mention in this abstract but will talk about
