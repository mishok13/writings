Definitions of maps -- elaborate in comments what's thematic, charts, etc
Add distance distortion
Add pictures to different surface projections
Combine different examples of Tissot's indicatrix on one slide each
Compare Iceland to Madagascar
Add more projections in general
More linking between projections, cartography, data, openstreetmap
WKT -- not standard, rather transport coding convention?
link from data to openstreetmap not clear

explain map resizing in mapnik section, it's not clear actually
drop metatiles at first, add later
add math explanation
more pictures at the end of each code part

Summary should include explanation on future investigation
time everything!
